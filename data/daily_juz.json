      "theme_explanation": "Juz 6 covers the transition from the legal and social framework of Surah An-Nisa to the dietary laws, covenants, and inter-faith dialogue found in Surah Al-Ma'idah. A recurring theme is the importance of fulfilling contracts—both with people and with Allah.",
      "surah_overview": "Surah Al-Ma'idah is one of the final major Surahs revealed. It contains the verse declaring the completion of the religion (5:3). It focuses on the 'Halal' and 'Haram', the sanctity of life, and provides a detailed critique of the deviations of previous nations to serve as a guide for the Muslim Ummah."
